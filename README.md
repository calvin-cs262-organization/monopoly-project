# CS 262 Project

This is a sample application for CS 262 at Calvin University that includes a
client and a server as separate repos in one GitHub organization.

Include your project vision statement in this main MD file. Then include
references to additional files for the other deliverables, such as:

- Design Models (e.g., this [design specification](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project/blob/master/design.md))

- Presentation Materials (e.g., this [sample presentation](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project/blob/master/presentations/presentation.pptx))

- Other documents (e.g., this [sample test script](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project/blob/master/documents/csWebsiteTestScript.docx)) 

The raw documents for these deliverables should be checked into this project repo or into some other web location so that they can be managed.

You will publish the following materials elsewhere:

- the codebases for your client and for your server will be separate repos
in your [team organization](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/)):
    - [Mobile Client](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-client)
    - [Data Service](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-service)
- your project management materials will be included in your team Trello board 
(e.g., see this [sample Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WpvdqCbd/cs262-overview)) 
and in your GitHub repos.
